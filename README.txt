== Description ==

The Indeed Jobs WordPress plugin was created in a 24 hour hackathon project. The project idea stemmed from discovering small businesses that posted their jobs on Indeed as well as their own sites. This plugin used Indeed's Publisher Network and Search API to display Indeed jobs within the small business wordpress site, taking on the site's CSS and design as well.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `test-indeed-jobs-plugin.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
